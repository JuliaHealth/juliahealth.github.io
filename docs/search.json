We’ll create a new folder just for your post to keep things organized.\n\nChoose a Name: Think of a short, descriptive name for your post folder. Including the date helps keep things chronological. For example, if you’re writing about DICOM tools on May 1st, 2025, you could use 2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro.\nCreate the Folder: In your terminal (make sure you are inside the JuliaHealthBlog directory), create your folder:\n# Example:\nmkdir posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro\n(Adjust posts/ if the directory name is different).\nNavigate Inside:\ncd posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro\nCreate the Main File: Inside this new folder, create your main blog post file. It must end with .qmd. Using index.qmd is a common convention, but you can use a more descriptive name if you prefer (e.g., dicom_intro.qmd).\n# Using the common convention:\ntouch index.qmd\n# Or using a descriptive name:\n# touch dicom_intro.qmd\n\nThis .qmd file is where you’ll write your actual blog post content. Any images or other files specific to your post will also go into this same folder."

    "section": "Step 4: Write Your Content (The Fun Part!)",
    "text": "Step 4: Write Your Content (The Fun Part!)\nNow, open your index.qmd (or your_filename.qmd) file in a text editor (like VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, etc.). A Quarto file has two main parts:\n\na) The YAML Header (Settings for Your Post)\nAt the very top of the file, enclosed by ``` lines, is a block of text called YAML. Think of it as a configuration section that tells Quarto and the website important details about your post. It might look intimidating, but it’s just key-value pairs.\nHere’s a detailed example you can adapt:\n---\n# --- REQUIRED ---\ntitle: \"My Awesome JuliaHealth Blog Post Title\" # Be descriptive and engaging!\ndescription: \"A short (1-2 sentence) summary of your post. This appears in previews and search results.\"\nauthor: \"Your Name (Optional: Your Affiliation or GitHub Handle)\"\ndate: \"2025-05-01\" # Use YYYY-MM-DD format for the publication date (or today's date)\n\n# --- OFTEN USED / RECOMMENDED ---\ncategories: # Keywords to help people find your post\n  - julia # General category\n  - package-showcase # e.g., if showing off a package\n  - tutorial # e.g., if it's a how-to guide\n  - medical-imaging # Specific domain\n  - DICOM.jl # Specific package/tool mentioned\ntoc: true # Set to 'true' to automatically create a Table of Contents (highly recommended for longer posts)\nbibliography: ./references.bib # Tells Quarto where to find your citation list (if you have one). Keep this file in the same folder.\n# csl: ./../../ieee-with-url.csl # Path to the citation style file. This makes citations look consistent.\n\n# --- OPTIONAL / ADVANCED ---\n# image: false\n# engine: julia # Uncomment ONLY if you have Julia code blocks (```julia) you want Quarto to run when building the site.\n# draft: true # Keep as true while writing; REMOVE or set to 'false' when ready to publish.\n---\nDon’t stress about getting this perfect initially. The title, author, date, description, and categories are the most important to start with.\n\n\nb) The Main Content (Using Markdown)\nBelow the ``` YAML block, you write your actual content using Markdown. Markdown is a simple text formatting syntax that’s easy to learn. Quarto adds extra features on top.\nHere are the basics:\n\nHeadings: Use # for the main title (Quarto often uses the title from YAML, so you might start with ## for sections), ## for major sections, ### for subsections, etc.\n## My First Section\nSome introductory text here.\n\n### A Sub-section\nMore details go here.\nParagraphs: Just type text. Separate paragraphs with a blank line.\nEmphasis: Use *italic text* or _italic text_ and **bold text** or __bold text__.\nCode: For inline code snippets, use backticks: `println(\"Hello, JuliaHealth!\")`. (Note: Inline code typically still uses backticks in standard Markdown/Quarto).\nCode Blocks: For longer code examples, use triple tildes, optionally specifying the language for nice highlighting:\nusing DICOM\n# Load a DICOM file\ndcm_data = dcm_parse(\"path/to/your/dicom_file.dcm\")\nprintln(\"Patient Name: \", dcm_data[(0x0010, 0x0010)]) # Access DICOM tag\nTip: If you uncommented engine: julia in the YAML header, Quarto can actually run this Julia code and include the output directly in your post!\nLists:\n\nUnordered (bullets): Use -, *, or + at the start of a line. &gt; \nOrdered (numbers): Use 1., 2., etc. &gt; \n\nLinks: Use [Text to display](URL). &gt;  &gt; Format for embedding a URL in a markdown file\nImages: Use ![Alternative text description for accessibility](./image_filename.png). Put the image file (e.g., image_filename.png) in the same folder as your .qmd file. The alt text is important! &gt;  &gt; Format for embedding an image in a markdown file\nCitations: If you need to cite papers or other sources:\n\nCreate a file named references.bib in the same folder as your .qmd file.\nAdd entries in BibTeX format (you can often export these from reference managers like Zotero or sites like Google Scholar). &gt; \nIn your text, cite using the key: [@Mitura2021MedEye3d]. Quarto will format it and add it to a reference list at the end. Example: This approach was used in MedEye3d [@Mitura2021MedEye3d].\n\n\nWrite naturally! Explain your concepts clearly. Use headings to structure your thoughts. Include code examples where helpful. Add images or diagrams if they aid understanding. Don’t feel pressured to write a massive post; sometimes short, focused articles are the most useful."

Did executed code produce the expected output?\nDo links work?\nAre citations rendered correctly? Is the reference list present?\nIs the Table of Contents there (if you enabled it)?\n\nIterate: If you find mistakes, go back to your .qmd file, fix them, save the file, and Quarto’s preview should update automatically in your browser (or you might need to re-run the quarto preview command).

All subsequent commits will be on this branch.\nStage Your Files (git add): Tell Git which files you want to include in your next save point. You need to add your .qmd file and any supporting files (images, .bib). The easiest way is often to add the entire directory you created:\n# Make sure the path is correct!\ngit add posts/2025-05-01-dicom-tools-intro/\nCommit Your Changes (git commit): Create a “save point” (a commit) with a descriptive message explaining what you did.\ngit commit -m \"feat: Add blog post on introductory DICOM tools\"\n# Or a simpler message:\n# git commit -m \"Add blog post: Introduction to DICOM Tools\"\nGood commit messages help everyone understand the history of the project.\nPush to Your Fork (git push): Send your new branch and its commit(s) from your local computer up to your fork on GitHub.\n# The '-u' sets up tracking for the branch on the first push\ngit push -u origin add-dicom-intro-post\n(Replace add-dicom-intro-post with your actual branch name).

    "text": "What Are Patient Pathways?\nPatient pathways refer to the journey that patients with specific medical conditions undergo in terms of their treatment. This concept goes beyond simple drug uptake statistics and looks at the sequence of treatments patients receive over time, including first-line treatments and subsequent therapies. Understanding patient pathways is essential for analyzing treatment patterns, adherence to clinical guidelines, and the disbursement of drugs. To analyze patient pathways, one would typically use real-world data from sources such as electronic health records, claims data, and registries. However, barriers such as data interoperability and resource requirements have hindered the full utilization of real-world data for this purpose.\nSo to address these challenges we (the JuliaHealth organization and I) want to develop a set of tools to extract and analyze these patient pathways. These sets of tools are based on the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model, which standardizes healthcare data to promote interoperability."

First, I created the repository with the name OMOPCDMPathways.jl. Once the repository was created, we needed to have a skeleton for a standard Julia repository. For this, we used the PkgTemplates.jl this provided a basic skeleton for the repository that included - folders for test suites, documentation, src code files, GitHub files, README and LICENSE file, TOML and citation files. All this we can further edit and modify as per our work. By default, PkgTemplate.jl uses Documenter.jl for the documentation part but as suggested and discussed with my mentor we decided to shift to DocumenterVitepress.jl for the documentation part. However, we still faced some deployment issues in the new documentation due to a few mistakes in the make.jl file, thanks to Anshul Singhvi for helping fix the Deployment issues with DocumenterVitepress. With this, we were ready with the documentation set up and fully functional. After we had shifted to DocumenterVitepress the main task now was to host the documentation, this was done using Github-Actions, detailed steps for hosting are provided at this page. Then we added the CodeCov to our package by triggering it via a dummy function and a corresponding test case for it. Also, the CI for the package was set up with it. And, now finally the repository was ready with test coverage, CI, and documentation fully functional repository ready. Here’s some snapshots of the documentation set-up:\n\n\nInitial documentation with Documenter.jl\n\n\n\nNew documentation using DocumenterVitepress.jl\n\nSo, as a part of it, I created this documentation which provides detailed steps for converting docs from Documenter to DocumenterVitepress."

The Database was formatted within a PostgreSQL database with installation instructions here are some instructions on how to set up Postgres in a Linux machine. However, I was provided with some more extra synthetic data from my mentor for further testing of the functionalities. Being a very large database we had to strategically download it further, my mentor helped me in setting up the Postgres on my local machine. Once, the database was set up proper testing was performed on it to check if things were as expected. With this, we were done with the database setup as well and could finally dive into the actual code logic for the Pathways synthesis."

Testing and Development setup on my local computer\nTo get a proper environment for functionality creation and concurrent testing we required a proper testing setup so that we could test the new functions made at the same time. This was done using Revise.jl, which helps to keep Julia sessions running without frequent restarts when making changes to code. It allowed me to edit my code, update packages, or switch git branches during a session, with changes applied immediately in the next command. My mentor helped me set it up, added Revise.jl to the global Julia environment, also PackageCompatUI that provides a terminal text interface to the [compat] section of a Julia Project.toml file, and finally made a Julia script by the name “startup.jl” out of it.

    "text": "4. Selecting Treatments of Interest\nSo, as a part of this, we used the previously mentioned research paper and discussion with the mentors we came up with logic for it. The first thing to do was to determine the moment in time from which selected treatments of interest should be included in the treatment pathway. The default is all treatments starting after the index date of the target cohort. For example, for a target cohort consisting of newly diagnosed patients, treatments after the moment of first diagnosis are included. However, it would also be desirable to include (some) treatments before the index date, for instance in case a specific disease diagnosis is only confirmed after initiating treatment. Therefore, periodPriorToIndex specifies the period (i.e. number of days) before the index date from which treatments should be included. We have created two dispatches for this function. After that proper testing and documentation are also added.\nA basic implementation for it is:\n\nConstruct a SQL query to select cohort_definition_id, subject_id, and cohort_start_date from a specified table, filtering by cohort_id.\nThe SQL query construction and execution was done using the FunSQL.jl library, in the below-shown manner:\n\nsql = From(tab) |&gt;\n            Where(Fun.in(Get.cohort_definition_id, cohort_id...)) |&gt;\n            Select(Get.cohort_definition_id, Get.subject_id, Get.cohort_start_date) |&gt;\n            q -&gt; render(q, dialect=dialect)\n\nExecutes the constructed SQL query using a database connection, fetching the results into a data frame.\nIf the DataFrame is not empty, convert cohort_start_date to DateTime and subtract date_prior from each date, then return the modified DataFrame.\n\nThis was then be called this:\nperiod_prior_to_index(\n        cohort_id = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], \n        conn; \n        date_prior = Day(100), \n        tab=cohort\n    )"

    "text": "5. Filters Applied\nAfter this, we where needed to get the patient’s database filtered more finely so that there are minimal variations that can be ignored. The duration of the above extracted event eras may vary a lot and it can be preferable to limit to only treatments exceeding a minimum duration. Hence, minEraDuration speciﬁes the minimum time an event era should last to be included in the analysis. All these implementations were more of Dataframe manipulation where I used DataFrames.jl package.\nAfter that proper testing and documentation are also added.\nA basic implementation for the minEraDuration is: It filters the treatment history DataFrame to retain only those rows where the duration between drug_exposure_end and drug_exposure_start is at least minEraDuration. This function can be used as follows:\n#| eval: false \n\ncalculate_era_duration(test_df, 920000)\n\n#= ... =#\n\n4×3 DataFrame\n Row │ person_id  drug_exposure_start  drug_exposure_end \n     │ Int64      Float64              Int64             \n─────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │         1           -3.7273e8          -364953600\n   2 │         1            2.90304e7           31449600\n   3 │         1           -8.18208e7          -80006400\n   4 │         1            1.32918e9         1330387200\nAnother filter we worked on is the EraCollapse. So, let’s suppose a case where an individual receives the same treatment for a long period of time (e.g. need for chronic treatment). Then it’s highly likely that the person would require refills. Now as patients are not 100% adherent, there might be a gap between two subsequent event eras. Usually, these eras are still considered as one treatment episode, and the eraCollapseSize deals with the maximum gap within which two eras of the same event cohort would be collapsed into one era (i.e. seen as a continuous treatment instead of a stop and re-initiation of the same treatment). After that proper testing and documentation are also added.\nA basic implementation for the eraCollapseSize is: (a) Sorts the data frame by event_start_date and event_end_date. (b) Calculates the gap between each era and the previous era. (c) Filters out rows with gap_same &gt; eraCollapseSize.\nThese functions can be used as follows:\n#| eval: false \n\n#= ... =#\n\nEraCollapse(treatment_history = test_df, eraCollapseSize = 400000000)\n4×4 DataFrame\n Row │ person_id  drug_exposure_start  drug_exposure_end  gap_same   \n     │ Int64      Float64              Int64              Float64    \n─────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n   1 │         1           -5.33347e8         -532483200  -1.86373e9\n   2 │         1           -3.7273e8          -364953600   1.59754e8\n   3 │         1           -8.18208e7          -80006400   2.83133e8\n   4 │         1            2.90304e7           31449600   1.09037e8"

Treatment History of the Patients\nThe create_treatment_history function constructs a detailed treatment history for patients in a target cohort by processing and filtering event cohort data from a given DataFrame. It begins by isolating the target cohort based on its cohort_id, adding a new column for the index_year derived from the cohort’s start date. Then, it selects relevant event cohorts based on a provided list of cohort IDs and merges them with the target cohort on the subject_id to associate events with individuals in the target group. The function applies different filtering criteria depending on whether the user is interested in treatments starting or ending within a specified period before the target cohort’s start date (defined by periodPriorToIndex). It keeps only the event cohorts that match the filtering condition, ensuring that only relevant treatments are considered. After filtering, the function calculates time gaps between consecutive cohort events for each patient, adding these gaps to the DataFrame. The final DataFrame provides a history of treatments, including the dates of events and the time intervals between them, offering a clear timeline of treatment for each patient. After that proper testing and documentation are also added."

    "text": "7. CombinationWindow Functionality To Combine Overlapping Treatments\nNow once we have the filtering of the treatments done, we need to combine the overlapping treatments based on some set of rules. The combinationWindow specifies the time that two event eras need to overlap to be considered a combination treatment. If there are more than two overlapping event eras, we sequentially combine treatments, starting from the ﬁrst two overlapping event eras.\nThe combination_Window function processes a patient’s treatment history by identifying overlapping treatment events and combining them into continuous treatment periods based on certain rules. It first converts event_cohort_id into strings and sorts the treatment data by person_id, event_start_date, and event_end_date. The helper function selectRowsCombinationWindow calculates gaps between consecutive treatments, marking rows where treatments overlap or occur too closely. In the main loop, the function checks these overlaps and gaps against a specified combinationWindow. If treatments overlap (or nearly overlap), the function adjusts the treatment periods by either merging adjacent rows or splitting rows to create continuous treatment periods. The process continues until all overlapping treatments are combined into one, creating an updated and accurate treatment history. The function ensures the final output reflects realistic treatment windows by handling special cases where gaps between treatments are smaller than the treatment durations themselves.\nIt mainly covers the three cases mentioned in the R-research paper:\n\nSwitch Case:\nCondition: If the gap between the two treatment events is smaller than the combinationWindow, but the gap is not equal to the duration of either event. Action: The event_end_date of the previous treatment is set to the event_start_date of the current treatment. This effectively “shifts” the previous treatment’s end date to eliminate the gap, merging the treatments into one continuous period. Purpose: This ensures that treatment gaps that are too small (less than combinationWindow) are treated as part of the same treatment window.\n#| eval: false \n\n#= ... =#\n\nif -gap_previous &lt; combinationWindow && !(-gap_previous in [duration_era, prev_duration_era])\n    treatment_history[i-1, :event_end_date] = treatment_history[i, :event_start_date]\nHere is the pictorial representation for the same: \n\n\nFRFS (First Row, First Shortened):\nCondition: If the gap is larger than or equal to the combinationWindow, or the gap equals the duration of one of the two treatments, and the first treatment ends before or on the same date as the second treatment. Action: A new row is created where the second treatment’s event_end_date is set to the end date of the first treatment. This preserves the overlap but ensures that the earlier treatment period stays intact. Purpose: This prevents unnecessary truncation of the first treatment if it spans the entire overlap window.\n#| eval: false \n\n#= ... =#\n\nelseif -gap_previous &gt;= combinationWindow || -gap_previous in [duration_era, prev_duration_era]\n    if treatment_history[i-1, :event_end_date] &lt;= treatment_history[i, :event_end_date]\n        new_row = deepcopy(treatment_history[i, :])\n        new_row.event_end_date = treatment_history[i-1, :event_end_date]\n        append!(treatment_history, DataFrame(new_row'))\nHere is the pictorial representation for the same: \n\n\nLRFS (Last Row, First Shortened):\nCondition: If the gap is larger than or equal to the combinationWindow, or the gap equals the duration of one of the treatments, and the first treatment ends after the second treatment. Action: The current treatment’s event_end_date is adjusted to match the event_end_date of the previous treatment. Purpose: This handles cases where the second treatment’s window should be shortened to prevent overlap with the previous treatment, merging them into a single continuous window.\n#| eval: false \n\n#= ... =#\n\nelse\n    treatment_history[i, :event_end_date] = treatment_history[i-1, :event_end_date]\nHere is the pictorial representation for the same: \n\nNote: However, There are a few things left to cover here, most of which are the documentation and writing the test suite for the same."

    "text": "Hello! 👋\nHi! I am Michela, I have a Master’s degree in Physics of Complex Systems and I am currently working as a software engineer in Rome, where I am from. During my studies, I became interested in the use of modeling and AI methods to improve healthcare and how these tools can be used to better understand how cultural and social backgrounds influence the health of individuals. I am also interested in the computational modeling of the brain and the human body and its implications for a better understanding of certain pathological conditions.\nWith these motivations in mind, I heard about Google Summer of Code. Since I had studied Julia in some courses and given that the language is expanding rapidly, I decided to find a project within Julia. As a result, I found the project of Jacob Zelko (@TheCedarPrince) to start this experience.\n\nIf you want to learn more about me, you can connect with me here: LinkedIn, GitHub\n\n\n\nProject Description\nIPUMS is the “world’s largest available single database of census microdata”, providing survey and census data from around the world. It includes several projects that provide a wide variety of datasets. The information and data collected by IPUMS are useful for comparative research, as well as for the analysis of individuals in their life contexts. These data can be used to create a more comprehensive dataset that will facilitate research on the social determinants of health for different types of diseases, social communities, and geographical areas.\n\n\nTo learn more about IPUMS, visit the website\n\n\n\nTasks and Goals\nThe primary objectives of this proposal are to:\n\nDevelop a native Julia package to interact with the APIs available around the datasets IPUMS provides.\nProvide useful utilities within this package for manipulating IPUMS datasets.\nCompose this package with the wider Julia ecosystem to enable novel research in health, economics, and more.\n\nTo achieve this, the work was distributed as follows:\n\nExpand some of the functionality developed in ipumsr IPUMS NHGIS\n\nCreate a link between OpenAPI documentation and the functions internally used in IPUMS.jl: updating already present functions, determining if updating is needed, and testing them\nDevelop functionality similar to the get_metadata_nghis function present in ipumsr\n\nUpdate IPUMS documentation\n\nSet up and deploy DocumenterVitepress.jl\n\nWrite a blog post on how IPUMS.jl can be composed within the ecosystem.\n\n\n\n\nHow the work was done\nThe first task was to migrate documents from Documenter to DocumenterVitepress.This issue aims to support the significant refactoring underway across JuliaHealth, aimed at improving the discoverability and cohesion of the JuliaHealth ecosystem, particularly about documentation. This issue is intended to create a more attractive entry point for new Julia users interested in health research within the Julia community. To accomplish this task, a dependency of DocumenterVitepress was added to the docs directory of the IPUMS.jl repository. Once this was done, the Documenter.jl make.jl file was migrated into a DocumenterVitepress.jl make.jl file. Working on the make.jl file, the pages structure were added to the web page explaining the IPUMS.jl package. With this in mind, those were added: 1. Home: to explain the main purpose of the package 2. Workflows: to explain the working process 3. How to: to give general information 4. Tutorials: to show how to use IPUMS.jl\n5. Examples: some examples of activities 6. Mission: to explain why the package is useful for the community 7. References: references used to write the pages.\nThis first task takes some time, especially setting up GitHub and cloning the repository locally. At this point, my experience with GitHub was really limited and I had to learn how to use the Git environment from scratch, for example how to do continuous integration (to commit code to a shared repository), documentation release and merge, and local testing. I found the support of my mentors and searching for material online was really helpful.\nThe second task was to update the documentation of IPUMS.jl by modifying the functionality within the model folder in the IPUMS.jl folder. The main aim of this task was to a description of the function and its attributes, an example of possible implementation and result, and finally to show how to use it. The documentation to be updated as of several types of functions: 1. Data extract 2. Data set 3. Data Table 4. Time series table 5. Error 6. Shapefile. Each of these macro-categories (from 1 to 4) contains a set of functions, each signaling the different expected output and specific purpose. Information about what each function does, and the meaning of each specific input variable, has been found on the IPUMS website and references have been made in the written documentation.\n\n\nHow to work with IPUMS\nAfter writing down the description of the function and the inputs, examples were formulated, starting from the IPUMS website: when you register at IPUMS, an API key is given. which is used, among other things, to run pre-written code on the website. This code contains examples of these functions, and these examples have been adapted by changing some input values and adapting them to work in the Julia framework. The latter task was done by simply rewriting some structures, such as dictionaries, maps, or lists, in the Julia language. Here is a small guide on how to set up working with the API: 1. Create an IPUMS account 2. Log in to your account 3. Copy the API key, which can be obtained from the website 4. Use the key to run the code that is already available on the IPUMS Developer Portal, where you will also find information about the variables and packages.\n\n\nFunctions testing\nA final task was to test the functions in the ‘api_IPUMSAPI.jl’ file. In this file, the function to be tested and other functions are defined and the most important ones are extracted to be available in the available throughout the framework. Some of the functions to be tested were the following:\n\nmetadata_nhgis_data_tables_get\nmetadata_nhgis_datasets_dataset_data_tables_data_table_get\nmetadata_nhgis_datasets_dataset_get\nmetadata_nhgis_datasets_get\n\nBefore working on the Julia files, testing and understanding the original R function was done using R studio.\n\nEach function was then tested using the API key from the IPUMS registration as well as other input examples taken from the documentation or the IPUMS website. or from the IPUMS website. All functions were displayed successfully, giving the expected result, so it can be concluded that the translation from R to Julia is successful.\n\nusing IPUMS\nusing OpenAPI\n\napi_key = \"insert your key here\"\n\nversion = \"2\"\npage_number = 1\npage_size = 2500\n#media_type = \n\napi = IPUMSAPI(\"https://api.ipums.org\", Dict(\"Authorization\" =&gt; api_key));\n\nres1 = metadata_nhgis_data_tables_get(api, version)\n\nres2 = metadata_nhgis_datasets_dataset_get(api, \"2022_ACS1\", \"2\");\n\nres3 = metadata_nhgis_datasets_dataset_data_tables_data_table_get(api, \"2022_ACS1\",\"B01001\", \"2\");\n\nres4 = metadata_nhgis_datasets_get(api, \"2\");\n\nAn example of the output is:\n. . .\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"NT1\",\n  \"nhgisCode\": \"AAA\",\n  \"description\": \"Total Population\",\n  \"universe\": \"Persons\",\n  \"sequence\": 1,\n  \"datasetName\": \"1790_cPop\",\n  \"nVariables\": [\n    1\n  ]\n}\n\n. . .\n\n\nAccomplished Goals and Future Development\nThe project was a 90-hour small project and during this time the documentation was completed and the testing of the metadata function was done, as well as the migration from Documenter.jl to DocumenterVitepress.jl. During these months some things took longer than I expected because of some problems that occurred, so some things were missing in relation to the original plan. However, this time was useful for learning new things: - I saw how to work with a package under development, how to work with large datasets, and how to write documentation - I had the opportunity to better understand how to work with Git and GitHub - I learned some new things about R, which was a completely unknown language to me. - I deepened my knowledge of Julia, a language I had worked with during my time at university. - I had the chance to work on a large open-source project, to be part of a large community, and to learn how to communicate with it efficiently.\nA special thanks goes to my mentors, Jacob Zelko and Krishna Bhogaonker, for helping me through this process.\nFuture developments of this work could include deepening the work that my mentors and I have started, with the possibility of integrating this package with other machine learning packages in Julia and, from there, doing new analyses of the data in terms of social and geographical implications for health.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{rocchetti2024,\n  author = {Rocchetti, Michela},\n  title = {GSoC ’24: {IPUMS.jl} {Small} {Project}},\n  date = {2024-08-26},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRocchetti, Michela. 2024. “GSoC ’24: IPUMS.jl Small\nProject.” August 26, 2024."

Troubleshooting along the way, we narrowed down the issue within the Rocket’s actor-subscription mechanism and decided to integrate Julia’s Base.Channel within MedEye3d.jl for handling the event and state management routine. Julia has asynchronous, threadsafe channels which facilitate in asynchronous programming with the help of a producer-consumer mechanism. An example usage of Base.Channel is as follows:\nfunction consumer(channel::Base.Channel)\n    while(true)\n    channelData::String = take!(channel)\n    println(\"Channel got \" * channelData)\n    end\nend\n\nnewChannel = Base.Channel(100)\n\n@async consumer(newChannel)\nput!(newChannel, \"apples\")\nJulia’s multiple dispatch made for the architectural setup of MedEye3d, facilitated fixing the issue of screen tearing.

Automatic windowing for most common MRI and PET modalities\nWindowing is a crucial aspect of medical imaging, particularly in MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and PET (Positron Emission Tomography) modalities. It enables radiologists to enhance the contrast of images, highlighting specific features and improving the overall diagnostic accuracy. Windowing involves controlling the display range of pixel values to optimize the contrast between different tissues or structures. The display range is defined by two values: the minimum (min) and maximum (max) values that contribute to the final range of pixels that are displayed. By adjusting these values, radiologists can enhance or suppress specific features in the image, facilitating a more accurate diagnosis.\nThe setTextureWindow function utilizes a set of predefined keymap controls to simplify the windowing process. The F1-F7 keys are designated for controlling windowing in MRI and PET modalities. The keymap controls are as follows:\n\nF1: Display wide window for bone (CT) or increase minimum value for PET\nF2: Display window for soft tissues (CT) or increase minimum value for PET\nF3: Display wide window for lung viewing (CT) or increase minimum value for PET\nF4: Decrease minimum value for display\nF5: Increase minimum value for display\nF6: Decrease maximum value for display\nF7: Increase maximum value for display\n\nImplementation of setTextureWindow Function\nThe setTextureWindow function is designed to update the texture window settings based on the input keymap control.

    "text": "5. Adding support for multi-image viewing with crosshair marker for image registration\nFollowing the mid-term evaluation, MedEye3d.jl underwent a significant enhancement, whereby a multi-image display capability was implemented through a series of refinements. Specifically, a novel approach was adopted, whereby separate OpenGL fragment shaders were introduced to concurrently render images on either side of the visualizer, namely the left and right views. Prior to integrating voxel data into the fragment shaders, an initial series of tests involved evaluating individual colors to validate the integrity of the double image display. A screenshot from one of these critical testing phases is presented below: \nThe shaders were further manipulated to automatically initialize for each of the images separately. Further, the reactive aspect of the visualizer in multi-image display mode was iterated upon and now, instead of a single state management struct, a vector of states was being passed around, facilitating the user to scroll each of the images separately just by simply hovering their mouse over either of the image, activating its relevant associated state struct.\nDown below, is the struct for state that handles all of the things currently related with an image:\n@with_kw mutable struct StateDataFields\n  currentDisplayedSlice::Int = 1 # stores information what slice number we are currently displaying\n  mainForDisplayObjects::forDisplayObjects = forDisplayObjects() # stores objects needed to  display using OpenGL and GLFW\n  onScrollData::FullScrollableDat = FullScrollableDat()\n  textureToModifyVec::Vector{TextureSpec} = [] # texture that we want currently to modify - if list is empty it means that we do not intend to modify any texture\n  isSliceChanged::Bool = false # set to true when slice is changed set to false when we start interacting with this slice - thanks to this we know that when we start drawing on one slice and change the slice the line would star a new on new slice\n  textDispObj::ForWordsDispStruct = ForWordsDispStruct()# set of objects and constants needed for text diplay\n  currentlyDispDat::SingleSliceDat = SingleSliceDat() # holds the data displayed or in case of scrollable data view for accessing it\n  calcDimsStruct::CalcDimsStruct = CalcDimsStruct()   #data for calculations of necessary constants needed to calculate window size , mouse position ...\n  valueForMasToSet::valueForMasToSetStruct = valueForMasToSetStruct() # value that will be used to set  pixels where we would interact with mouse\n  lastRecordedMousePosition::CartesianIndex{3} = CartesianIndex(1, 1, 1) # last position of the mouse  related to right click - usefull to know onto which slice to change when dimensions of scroll change\n  forUndoVector::AbstractArray = [] # holds lambda functions that when invoked will  undo last operations\n  maxLengthOfForUndoVector::Int64 = 15 # number controls how many step at maximum we can get back\n  fieldKeyboardStruct::KeyboardStruct = KeyboardStruct()\n  displayMode::DisplayMode = SingleImage\n  imagePosition::Int64 = 1\n  switchIndex::Int = 1\n  mainRectFields::GlShaderAndBufferFields = GlShaderAndBufferFields()\n  crosshairFields::GlShaderAndBufferFields = GlShaderAndBufferFields()\n  textFields::GlShaderAndBufferFields = GlShaderAndBufferFields()\n  spacingsValue::Union{Vector{Tuple{Float64,Float64,Float64}},Tuple{Float64,Float64,Float64}} = [(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)]\n  originValue::Union{Vector{Tuple{Float64,Float64,Float64}},Tuple{Float64,Float64,Float64}} = [(1.0, 1.0, 1.0)]\n  supervoxelFields::GlShaderAndBufferFields = GlShaderAndBufferFields()\nend\nAfter the integrity of the fragment shaders was verified in multi-image, voxel data for the images was integrated and further modifications to the high-level functions were made and eventually the following script produced a rather appealing result.\nScript for loading the same NIFTI image twice in the visualizer for side-by-side display:\nusing MedEye3d\nctNiftiImage = \"/home/hurtbadly/Downloads/ct_soft_study.nii.gz\"\nMedEye3d.SegmentationDisplay.displayImage([[ctNiftiImage],[ctNifitImage]])\n\nResults in :\n\n\nCrosshair marker for image registration are displayed in the relevant passive image to hightlight the same anatomical regions based on the spatial meta-data of the images i.e spacing, origin and direction. In order to achive the crosshair rendering in the passive image, the following action items were devised:\n\nRetrieval of GLFW Mouse Callbacks for x and y position of the cursor in window coordinates (0 to window-width) from the active image\nConversion of these x and y window coordinates into their relevant active image x and y texture coordinates\nConversion of these texture coordinates into real space point with the help of spatial metadata\nConversion of the real space point into the texture coordinates of the passive image\nConversion of the passive image texture coordinates into their relevant OpenGL coordinate system values (-1 to 1)\nRendering of crosshair on OpenGL coordinate in passive image\n\nConversion between different coordinate systems and accounting for the image’s spatial metadata during calculating proved to be challenging at first, but with multiple revisions, a final solution was achieved with seemingly no noticeable amount of lag or delay.

    "text": "6. Adding support for the display of SuperVoxels sv with borders within the image slices to better understand anatomical regions within slices\nIn enhancing MedEye3d’s functionality, supporting super voxels (sv) with boundaries becomes paramount. The sv rendering, effectively capturing gradients, serves as the cornerstone for detecting these boundaries within both MRI and PET volumes. Supervoxels, described either through indicator masks or meshes, encapsulate regions of interest with distinct image characteristics. By integrating boundary detection for super-voxels, MedEye3d can offer enhanced segmentation capabilities, enabling more precise delineation and analysis of anatomical structures and pathological regions within medical imaging data.\nSupervoxels are basically a collection of voxels that share similar image properties. For example: in MRI scans of the brain cortex, super voxels could represent clusters of voxels corresponding to specific anatomical regions or functional areas. The main objective of this task was to add support for the display of super voxel-based segmentation of images, followed by some janitorial tasks:\n\nDisplay of the borders of super-voxels (sv), extracted using the machine learning algorithms.\nChecking image gradient agreement with super-voxel borders.\n\nThis initial workflow involved, the initialization of relevant buffers in OpenGL for dynamic rendering of lines over the image display, namely vertex array buffers (vao), vertex buffers (vbo) and edge buffers (ebo). Further, these buffers are updated on a scroll event, where the information from the currently displayed slice is passed to the event handler, which invokes a function that updates the vertex buffer (vbo) with new vertices pertaining to the relevant slice number and planar view, precalculated from an HDF5 file during initialization of the visualizer. For instance, if the user is scrolling in the 3rd axis (transversal plane) and is currently on slice 40, the supervoxel display will pertain to edges specifically calculated for that specific slice in that plane.\nEventually, with ever so increasing number of attempts and a few hurdles along the way, one of which particularly stood out since it marked our first step towards a good direction:\n\nChallenges in rendering\n\n\nAt last, an appealing result hit our sight.\n\nFinal result\n\n\nNote: The image borders are intentional to emphasize the size of the visualizer which is currently defaulted to a certain width and height.\n\n\n\nNote: However, There are a few things left to cover here, most of which revolve around MedImages.jl and documentation for the same.

This type of research plays a vital role in informing decisions by clinicians, policymakers, and researchers, especially when addressing population-level health questions and disparities.\nA core aspect of observational health is the use of phenotype definitions, which describe a specific set of observable patient characteristics (e.g., diagnosis codes, symptoms, demographics, biomarkers) that define a population of interest. Creating accurate and reproducible phenotype definitions is essential for ensuring research validity. However, challenges such as missing data, demographic biases, and inconsistently recorded information can significantly impact the reliability of these definitions.\nTo support reproducible research at scale, communities like OHDSI (Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics) have developed standards such as the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM) and workflows for developing computable phenotype definitions.\nIn our work, we utilize observational health data already structured through the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). We construct patient cohorts based on existing phenotype definitions. These cohorts then serve as the basis for building patient-level prediction models, enabling us to explore and generate insights that can support data-driven clinical decision-making."

    "text": "Cohort Construction\nCohorts are groups of patients defined by specific criteria that are relevant to the research question. For this task, two main cohorts need to be defined:\n\nTarget Cohort: This refers to the group of patients we want to make predictions for. In our case, it includes patients who have been diagnosed with hypertension. These patients serve as the starting point for our prediction timeline.\nOutcome Cohort: This refers to the clinical event we aim to predict. In our case, it includes patients from the target cohort who are subsequently diagnosed with diabetes within a specified time window. This event marks the outcome that our model will learn to forecast.\n\nThese cohort definitions are central to structuring the data pipeline, as they form the foundation for downstream tasks like feature extraction, model training, and evaluation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hi! 👋\nI am Ryan, an MS student currently studying computer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Looking for a project to work on this summer, my interest in high-performance computing and affinity for the Julia programming language drew me to Google Summer of Code, where I learned about this project opportunity to work on enhancing GPU support for KomaMRI.jl.\nIn this post, I’d like to summarize what I did this summer and everything I learned along the way!\n\nIf you want to learn more about me, you can connect with me here: LinkedIn, GitHub\n\n\n\nWhat is KomaMRI?\nKomaMRI is a Julia package for efficiently simulating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions. MRI simulation is a useful tool for researchers, as it allows testing new pulse sequences to analyze the signal output and image reconstruction quality without needing to actually take an MRI, which may be time or cost-prohibitive.\nIn contrast to many other MRI simulators, KomaMRI.jl is open-source, cross-platform, and comes with an intuitive user interface (To learn more about KomaMRI, you can read the paper introducing it here). However, being developed fairly recently, there are still new features that can be added and optimization to be done.\n\n\nProject Goals\nThe goals outlined by Carlos (my project mentor) and I the beginning of this summer were:\n\nExtend GPU support beyond CUDA to include AMD, Intel, and Apple Silicon GPUs, through the packages AMDGPU.jl, oneAPI.jl, and Metal.jl\nCreate a CI pipeline to be able to test each of the GPU backends\nCreate a new kernel-based simulation method optimized for the GPU, which we expected would outperform array broadcasting\n(Stretch Goal) Look into ways to support running distributed simulations across multiple nodes or GPUs\n\n\n\nStep 1: Support for Different GPU backends\nPreviously, KomaMRI’s support for GPU acceleration worked by converting each array used within the simulation to a CuArray, the device array type defined in CUDA.jl. This was done through a general gpu function. The inner simulation code is GPU-agnostic, as the same operations can be performed on a CuArray or a plain CPU Array. This approach is good for extensibility, as it does not require writing different simulation code for the CPU / GPU, or different GPU backends, and would only work in a language like Julia based on runtime dispatch!\nTo extend this to multiple GPU backends, all that is needed is to generalize the gpu function to convert to either the device types of CUDA.jl, AMDGPU.jl, Metal.jl, or oneAPI.jl, depending on which backend is being used. To give an idea of what the gpu conversion code looked like before, here is a snippet:\nstruct KomaCUDAAdaptor end\nadapt_storage(to::KomaCUDAAdaptor, x) = CUDA.cu(x)\n\nfunction gpu(x)\n    check_use_cuda()\n    return use_cuda[] ? fmap(x -&gt; adapt(KomaCUDAAdaptor(), x), x; exclude=_isleaf) : x\nend\n\n#CPU adaptor\nstruct KomaCPUAdaptor end\nadapt_storage(to::KomaCPUAdaptor, x::AbstractArray) = adapt(Array, x)\nadapt_storage(to::KomaCPUAdaptor, x::AbstractRange) = x\n\ncpu(x) = fmap(x -&gt; adapt(KomaCPUAdaptor(), x), x)\nThe fmap function is from the package Functors.jl and can recursively apply a function to a struct tagged with @functor. The function being applied is adapt from Adapt.jl, which will call the lower-level adapt_storage function to actually convert to / from the device type. The second parameter to adapt is what is being adapted, and the first is what it is being adapted to, which in this case is a custom adapter struct KomaCUDAAdapter.\nOne possible approach to generalize to different backends would be to define additional adapter structs for each backend and corresponding adapt_storage functions. This is what the popular machine learning library Flux.jl does. However, there is a simpler way!\nEach backend package (CUDA.jl, Metal.jl, etc.) already defines adapt_storage functions for converting different types to / from corresponding device type. Reusing these functions is preferable to defining our own since, not only does it save work, but it allows us to rely on the expertise of the developers who wrote those packages! If there is an issue with types being converted incorrectly that is fixed in one of those packages, then we would not need to update our code to get this fix since we are using the definitions they created.\nOur final gpu and cpu functions are very simple. The backend parameter is a type derived from the abstract Backend type of KernelAbstractions.jl, which is extended by each of the backend packages:\nimport KernelAbstractions as KA\n\nfunction gpu(x, backend::KA.GPU)\n    return fmap(x -&gt; adapt(backend, x), x; exclude=_isleaf)\nend\n\ncpu(x) = fmap(x -&gt; adapt(KA.CPU(), x), x, exclude=_isleaf)\nThe other work needed to generalize our GPU support involved switching to use package extensions to avoid having each of the backend packages as an explicit dependency, and defining some basic GPU functions for backend selection and printing information about available GPU devices. The pull request for adding support for multiple backends is linked below:\n\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/405\n\n\n\nStep 2: Buildkite CI\nAt the time the above pull request was merged, we weren’t sure whether the added support for AMD and Intel GPUs actually worked, since we only had access to CUDA and Apple Silicon GPUs. So the next step was to set up a CI to test each GPU backend. To do this, we used Buildkite, which is a CI platform that many other Julia packages also use. Since there were many examples to follow, setting up our testing pipeline was not too difficult. Each step of the pipeline does the required environment setup and then calls Pkg.test() for KomaMRICore. As an example, here is what the AMDGPU step of our pipeline looks like:\n      - label: \"AMDGPU: Run tests on v{{matrix.version}}\"\n        matrix:\n          setup:\n            version:\n              - \"1\"\n        plugins:\n          - JuliaCI/julia#v1:\n              version: \"{{matrix.version}}\"\n          - JuliaCI/julia-coverage#v1:\n              codecov: true\n              dirs:\n                - KomaMRICore/src\n                - KomaMRICore/ext\n        command: |\n          julia -e 'println(\"--- :julia: Instantiating project\")\n              using Pkg\n              Pkg.develop([\n                  PackageSpec(path=pwd(), subdir=\"KomaMRIBase\"),\n                  PackageSpec(path=pwd(), subdir=\"KomaMRICore\"),\n              ])'\n          \n          julia --project=KomaMRICore/test -e 'println(\"--- :julia: Add AMDGPU to test environment\")\n              using Pkg\n              Pkg.add(\"AMDGPU\")'\n          \n          julia -e 'println(\"--- :julia: Running tests\")\n              using Pkg\n              Pkg.test(\"KomaMRICore\"; coverage=true, test_args=[\"AMDGPU\"])'\n        agents:\n          queue: \"juliagpu\"\n          rocm: \"*\"\n        timeout_in_minutes: 60\nWe also decided that in addition to a testing CI, it would also be helpful to have a benchmarking CI to track performance changes resulting from each commit to the main branch of the repository. Lux.jl had a very nice-looking benchmarking page, so I decided to look into their approach. They were using github-action-benchmark, a popular benchmarking action that integrates with the Julia package BenchmarkTools.jl. github-action-benchmark does two very useful things:\n\nCollects benchmarking data into a json file and provides a default index.html to display this data. If put inside a relative path in the gh-pages branch of a repository, this results in a public benchmarking page which is automatically updated after each commit!\nComments on a pull request with the benchmarking results compared with before the pull request. Example: https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/442#pullrequestreview-2213921334\n\nThe only issue was that since github-action-benchmark is a github action, it is meant to be run within github by one of the available github runners. While this works for CPU benchmarking, only Buildkite has the CI setup for each of the GPU backends we are using, and Lux.jl’s benchmarks page only included CPU benchmarks, not GPU benchmarks (Note: we talked with Avik, the repository owner of Lux.jl, and Lux.jl has since adopted the approach outlined below to display GPU and CPU benchmarks together). I was not able to find any examples of other julia packages using github-action-benchmark for GPU benchmarking.\nFortunately, there is a tool someone developed to download results from Buildkite into a github action (https://github.com/EnricoMi/download-buildkite-artifact-action). This repository only had 1 star when I found it, but it does exactly what we needed: it identifies the corresponding Buildkite build for a commit, waits for it to finish, and then downloads the artifacts for the build into the github action it is being run from. With this, we were able to download the Buildkite benchmark results from a final aggregation step into our benchmarking action and upload to github-action-benchmark to publish to either the main data.js file for our benchmarking website, or pull request.\nOur final benchmarking page looks like this and is publicly accessible:\n\nOne neat thing about github-action-benchmark is that the default index.html is extensible, so even though by deault it only shows time, the information for memory usage and number of allocations is also collected into the json file, and can be displayed as well.\nA successful CI run on Buildkite Looks like this:\n\nThe pull requests for creating the CI testing and benchmarking pipeline, and changing the index.html for our benchmark page are listed below:\n\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/411\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/418\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/421\n\n\n\nStep 3: Optimization\nWith support for multiple backends enabled, and a robust CI, the next step was to optimize our simulation code as much as possible. Our original idea was to create a new GPU-optimized simulation method, but before doing this we wanted to look more at the existing code and optimize for the CPU.\nThe simulation code is solving a differential equation (the [Bloch equations(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_equations)]) over time. Most differential equation solvers step through time, updating the current state at each time step, but our previous simulation code, more optimized for the GPU, did a lot of computations across all time points in a simulation block, allocating a matrix of size Nspins by NΔt each time this was done. Although this is beneficial for the GPU, where there are millions of threads available on which to parallelize these computations, for the CPU it is more important to conserve memory, and the aforementioned approach of stepping through time is preferable.\nAfter seeing that this approach did help speed up simulation time on the CPU, but was not faster on the GPU (7x slower for Metal!) we decided to separate our simulation code for the GPU and CPU, dispatching based on the KernelAbstractions.Backend type depending on if it is &lt;:KernelAbstractions.CPU or &lt;:KernelAbstractions.GPU.\nOther things we were able to do to speed up CPU computation time:\n\nPreallocating each array used inside the core simulation code so it can be re-used from one simulation block to the next.\nSkipping an expensive computation if the magnetization at that time point is not added to the final signal\nEnsuring that each statement is fully broadcasted. We were surprised to see the difference between the following examples:\n\n#Fast\nBz = x .* seq.Gx' .+ y .* seq.Gy' .+ z .* seq.Gz' .+ p.Δw ./ T(2π .* γ)\n\n#Slow\nBz = x .* seq.Gx' .+ y .* seq.Gy' .+ z .* seq.Gz' .+ p.Δw / T(2π * γ)\n\nUsing the cis function for complex exponentiation, which is faster than exp\n\nWith these changes, the mean improvement in simulation time aggregating across each of our benchmarks for 1, 2, 4, and 8 CPU threads was ~4.28. For 1 thread, the average improvement in memory usage was 90x!\nThe next task was optimizing the simulation code for the GPU. Although our original idea was to put everything into one GPU kernel, we found that the existing broadcasting operations were already very fast, and that custom kernels we wrote were not able to outperform the previous implementation. The Julia GPU compiler team deserves a lot of credit for developing such fast broadcasting implementations!\nHowever, this does not mean that we were unable to improve the GPU simulation time. Similar to with the CPU, preallocation made a substantial difference. Parallelizing as much work as possible across the time points for a simulation block was also found to beneficial. For the parts that needed to be done sequentially, a custom GPU kernel was written which used the KernelAbstractions.@localmem macro for arrays being updated at each time step to yield faster memory access.\nThe mean speedup we saw across the 4 supported GPU backends was 4.16, although this varied accross each backend (for example, CUDA was only 2.66x faster while oneAPI was 28x faster). There is a remaining bottleneck in the run_spin_preceession! function having to do with logical indexing that I was not able to resolve, but could be solved in the future to speed up the GPU simulation time even further!\nThe pull requests optimizing code for the CPU and GPU are below:\n\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/443\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/459\nhttps://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/462\n\n\n\n4. Step 4: Distributed Support\nThis last step was a stretch goal for exploring how to add distributed support to KomaMRI. MRI simulations can become quite large, so it is useful to be able to distribute work across either multiple GPUs or multiple compute nodes.\nA nice thing about MRI simulation is the independent spin property: if a phantom object (representing, for example a brain tissue slice) is divided into two parts, and each part is simulated separately, the signal result from simulating the whole phantom will be equal to the sum of the signal results from simulating each subdivision of the original phantom. This makes it quite easy to distribute work, either across more than one GPU or accross multiple compute nodes.\nThe following scripts worked, with the only necessary code change to the repository being a new + function to add two RawAcquisitionData structs:\n#Use multiple GPUs:\nusing Distributed\nusing CUDA\n\n#Add workers based on the number of available devices\naddprocs(length(devices()))\n\n#Define inputs on each worker process\n@everywhere begin\n    using KomaMRI, CUDA\n    sys = Scanner()\n    seq = PulseDesigner.EPI_example()\n    obj = brain_phantom2D()\n    #Divide phantom\n    parts = kfoldperm(length(obj), nworkers())\nend\n\n#Distribute simulation across workers\nraw = Distributed.@distributed (+) for i=1:nworkers()\n    KomaMRICore.set_device!(i-1) #Sets device for this worker, note that CUDA devices are indexed from 0\n    simulate(obj[parts[i]], seq, sys)\nend\n#Use multiple compute nodes\nusing Distributed\nusing ClusterManagers\n\n#Add workers based on the specified number of SLURM tasks\naddprocs(SlurmManager(parse(Int, ENV[\"SLURM_NTASKS\"])))\n\n#Define inputs on each worker process\n@everywhere begin\n    using KomaMRI\n    sys = Scanner()\n    seq = PulseDesigner.EPI_example()\n    obj = brain_phantom2D()\n    parts = kfoldperm(length(obj), nworkers())\nend\n\n#Distribute simulation across workers\nraw = Distributed.@distributed (+) for i=1:nworkers()\n    simulate(obj[parts[i]], seq, sys)\nend\nPull reqeust for adding these examples to the KomaMRI documentation: https://github.com/JuliaHealth/KomaMRI.jl/pull/468\n\n\nConclusions / Future Work\nThis project was a 350-hour large project, since there were many goals to accomplish. To summarize what changed since the beginning of the project:\n\nAdded support for AMDGPU.jl, Metal.jl, and oneAPI.jl GPU backends\nCI for automated testing and benchmarking accross each backend + public benchmarks page\nSignificantly faster CPU and GPU performance\nDemonstrated distributed support and examples added in documentation\n\nFuture work could look at ways to further optimize the simulation code, since despite the progress made, I believe there is more work to be done! The aforementioned logical indexing issue is still not resolved, and the kernel used inside the run_spin_excitation! function has not been profiled in depth. KomaMRI is also looking into adding support for higher-order ODE methods, which could require more GPU kernels being written.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\nI would like to thank my mentor, Carlos Castillo, for his help and support on this project.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome back to the final part of the blog series on building a Patient-Level Prediction (PLP) Pipeline in Julia using the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM).\nIn this concluding post, we’ll reflect on the full journey – from cohort definition and feature extraction to preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. We’ll dig into what worked well, what challenges emerged, and what lessons were learned while building this pipeline from scratch using Julia. This post aims to bring the series full circle, offering insights into the practical realities of working with real-world health data and setting the stage for future work and improvements.\n\n\nIn Part 1, we introduced the motivation and core question driving the pipeline:\n\nAmong patients diagnosed with hypertension, who will go on to develop diabetes?\n\nWe chose this prediction problem because of its clinical relevance and because hypertension and diabetes are both common chronic conditions with strong associations in literature. To handle the data, we used the OMOP CDM format, which ensures that real-world patient data is structured in a consistent and analysis-friendly way.\nTo extract patient cohorts, we used OHDSICohortExpressions.jl, which allowed us to define concept sets and logic for cohort inclusion and exclusion.\nIn Part 2, we built a modular Patient-Level Prediction pipeline using the Julia ecosystem:\n\nFeature extraction: involved pulling demographic, condition, drug, and visit data, encoding it as binary presence indicators.\nPreprocessing: included handling missing values, one-hot encoding, normalization, and creating train-test splits.\nModel training: used the MLJ.jl framework to train logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.\nEvaluation: involved computing AUC and accuracy for binary classification.\n\n\n\n\nThe OHDSI ecosystem, particularly its PatientLevelPrediction package in R, offers an end-to-end solution that integrates tightly with ATLAS and standardized vocabularies. It handles cohort creation, covariate extraction, modeling, and visualization all in one environment.\nBuilding this pipeline in Julia offered a solid balance of flexibility and control. While most tasks, such as cohort extraction and model evaluation, were efficiently handled using existing Julia packages, a few areas required more custom implementation. These instances, though limited, provided valuable learning experiences, deepening my understanding of how the components of the pipeline interact, how features are generated, and how decisions at each stage impact model performance.\n\n\n\nAfter preprocessing the features and labels, model performance was not as strong as expected. The AUC values for the classifiers were relatively low for the models:\n\nLogistic Regression (L1-regularized): AUC ≈ 0.097\nRandom Forest: AUC ≈ 0.485\nXGBoost: AUC ≈ 0.52\n\nThese unexpectedly low model performances prompted a deeper investigation into the root causes. The primary issue was that the data available in our synthetic OMOP CDM was not well-suited to answer the research question: “From those diagnosed with hypertension, who goes on to develop diabetes?”\nTemporal context was also missing, as the features extracted were basic binary indicators that did not reflect the timing or frequency of clinical events. The one-year prediction window might have been too narrow for diabetes to develop meaningfully after a hypertension diagnosis. Many patients had very limited observation time before their index date, which weakened the reliability of feature construction. This further constrained the ability of the models to generalize well to new cases.\nAdditionally, many patients did not match our cohort criteria or had insufficient data to form meaningful predictions. The dataset size may have been too small to detect strong patterns or relationships between hypertension and subsequent diabetes development, especially given that the synthetic dataset may not have represented real-world complexities fully.\nThese issues suggest that the bottleneck wasn’t the modeling itself, but rather the mismatch between the research question and the available data, especially within the constraints of synthetic data. The limited sample size and the difficulty in matching the right cohort to the research question further impacted the model’s ability to make reliable predictions.\n\n\n\nThroughout the process, we encountered several technical and conceptual challenges:\nThe most critical issue lay in the quality and structure of the data itself. Many patients had sparse or short observation periods, which meant that only limited clinical history was available before the cohort entry date.\nThis directly affected the utility of the extracted features. On the modeling side, integrating with MLJ.jl required careful setup, especially when handling missing values, categorical encodings, and class imbalance.\n\n\n\nMLJ.jl\n\n\nFeature engineering was another bottleneck, since most features were binary flags or simple counts that did not capture clinical nuance or temporal dynamics. Preprocessing steps like normalization and imputation also needed fine-tuning and often had to be manually adjusted per model.\n\n\n\nAs I look to enhance the pipeline, improving the code and modularizing it for reusability is a top priority. I plan to refine the existing functions and ensure that the pipeline can handle different types of OMOP CDM datasets, including exploring other tables that could enrich the features we extract. Additionally, I’m particularly interested in incorporating temporal-based prediction features, which would allow us to account for the sequence of patient events over time and improve model accuracy.\nOne direction I’m especially excited about is building interfaces in Julia to streamline the PLP process.

To handle the data, we used the OMOP CDM format, which ensures that real-world patient data is structured in a consistent and analysis-friendly way.\nTo extract patient cohorts, we used OHDSICohortExpressions.jl, which allowed us to define concept sets and logic for cohort inclusion and exclusion.\nIn Part 2, we built a modular Patient-Level Prediction pipeline using the Julia ecosystem:\n\nFeature extraction: involved pulling demographic, condition, drug, and visit data, encoding it as binary presence indicators.\nPreprocessing: included handling missing values, one-hot encoding, normalization, and creating train-test splits.\nModel training: used the MLJ.jl framework to train logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost models.\nEvaluation: involved computing AUC and accuracy for binary classification."

It handles cohort creation, covariate extraction, modeling, and visualization all in one environment.\nBuilding this pipeline in Julia offered a solid balance of flexibility and control. While most tasks, such as cohort extraction and model evaluation, were efficiently handled using existing Julia packages, a few areas required more custom implementation. These instances, though limited, provided valuable learning experiences, deepening my understanding of how the components of the pipeline interact, how features are generated, and how decisions at each stage impact model performance."

    "text": "After preprocessing the features and labels, model performance was not as strong as expected. The AUC values for the classifiers were relatively low for the models:\n\nLogistic Regression (L1-regularized): AUC ≈ 0.097\nRandom Forest: AUC ≈ 0.485\nXGBoost: AUC ≈ 0.52\n\nThese unexpectedly low model performances prompted a deeper investigation into the root causes. The primary issue was that the data available in our synthetic OMOP CDM was not well-suited to answer the research question: “From those diagnosed with hypertension, who goes on to develop diabetes?”\nTemporal context was also missing, as the features extracted were basic binary indicators that did not reflect the timing or frequency of clinical events. The one-year prediction window might have been too narrow for diabetes to develop meaningfully after a hypertension diagnosis. Many patients had very limited observation time before their index date, which weakened the reliability of feature construction. This further constrained the ability of the models to generalize well to new cases.\nAdditionally, many patients did not match our cohort criteria or had insufficient data to form meaningful predictions. The dataset size may have been too small to detect strong patterns or relationships between hypertension and subsequent diabetes development, especially given that the synthetic dataset may not have represented real-world complexities fully.\nThese issues suggest that the bottleneck wasn’t the modeling itself, but rather the mismatch between the research question and the available data, especially within the constraints of synthetic data. The limited sample size and the difficulty in matching the right cohort to the research question further impacted the model’s ability to make reliable predictions."

On the modeling side, integrating with MLJ.jl required careful setup, especially when handling missing values, categorical encodings, and class imbalance.\n\n\n\nMLJ.jl\n\n\nFeature engineering was another bottleneck, since most features were binary flags or simple counts that did not capture clinical nuance or temporal dynamics.

I will not start typically, but so that anyone even a novice can visualize what this project has achieved, while the latter part is intended for more experienced readers. It will be easiest to divide it into 4 steps separated by ➡️ in the title above. Each emoji stands for a different piece of pipeliner and will be described below.\n📝🩻📎📉 What we need from the user\nMedPipe3D requires four essential inputs from the user to get started: a clear action plan 📝, 3D medical images like MRI scans 🩻, an AI model 📎, and a loss function 📉.\n🗃️📚♻️🧑‍🏫 The Pipeline essential AI manufacturing line\nFollowing the plan 📝, MedPipe3D loads data, pre-processes, and organizes it 🗃️. Allowing data to be easily split 📚, and efficiently augmented ♻️ in many ways for learning AI 🧑‍🏫 model effectively. In the end, performing testing and post-processing for better determination of AI skills.\nIt’s designed to transform raw medical data into a format that your AI can learn from, segmenting meaningful patterns and structures.\n🤖👁️📈 Results and Insights\nMedPipe3D is a tool for researchers and for that, it cannot do without analysis, testing, and evaluation. The result of the pipeline is a model 🤖 as well as data 👁️ and logs 📈 needed in MedEval3D that are ready for visualization and further analysis with MedEye3D. In a nutshell, it makes visualizing results easy, tumor locations or other medical features directly as masks on the scans.\n❤️‍🩹 Purpose-Driven Technology\nMedPipe3D’s mission goes beyond technology. It’s about providing the tools to create AIs that support healthcare professionals in making faster, more accurate decisions, with the ultimate goal of saving lives.\nThis four-part journey captures the heart of the MedPipe3D toolkit for advancing medical AI, from raw data to life-saving insight.\n\n\nMedPipe3D is a framework created from hundreds of hours over summer vacation, thousands of lines of code, hundreds of mistakes, and most importantly the guidance of my mentor and author of all of these libraries Dr. Jakub Mitura. At its core, MedPipe3D combines sophisticated data handling from MedImage thanks to the hard work of Divyansh Goyal. Newly developed pipeline for model training, validation, and testing with existing MedEval3D, and result visualization with MedEye3D. Unfortunately, not all of the project’s goals have been fully achieved, and thereby there is one section ➡️ too many. Hopefully not for long. My name is Jan Zubik, and I wrote this entire library from scratch, which is currently my most complex project.\nIf you are a data scientist, programmer, or code enthusiast, I invite you to read the next section where I go into detail and present version 1 of this tool in detail.\nI’m a 3rd-year student of BSc in Data Science and Machine Learning, I know that many things can be done better, expanded, debugged, and optimized. Now it just works, but don’t hesitate to write to me personally on LinkedIn, Julia’s Slack or GitHub!

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome to the vibrant and expanding world of JuliaHealth! As our community grows and the number of powerful Julia packages dedicated to health, medicine, and biomedical research increases, we’re seeing natural clusters of activity form around specific domains. To foster collaboration, improve discoverability, and accelerate progress in these specialized areas, we’re excited to introduce the concept of Sub-Ecosystems within JuliaHealth.\nThis post aims to:\n\nExplain what we mean by a “sub-ecosystem.”\nHighlight some of the prominent and emerging focus areas we see.\nInvite you to participate in shaping and growing these vital communities within the broader JuliaHealth organization.\n\n\nWhat is a JuliaHealth Sub-Ecosystem?\nThink of JuliaHealth as a large, bustling city. A sub-ecosystem is like a specialized district within that city – a place where people working on similar problems congregate, share tools, develop specific expertise, and collaborate closely.\nMore formally, a JuliaHealth sub-ecosystem is:\n\nA collection of related Julia packages addressing challenges within a specific health domain (e.g., medical imaging, observational health data).\nA community of developers and users passionate about that domain.\nA focal point for collaboration, potentially leading to shared standards, interoperable tools, and targeted documentation or tutorials within that niche.\n\nThese aren’t rigid silos, but rather areas of concentrated effort that make it easier for newcomers and veterans alike to find relevant tools and expertise.\n\n\nWhy Sub-Ecosystems? The Benefits\nStructuring our community efforts around these focus areas offers several advantages:\n\nImproved Discoverability: Newcomers looking for tools for, say, MRI simulation or analyzing OMOP CDM data can more easily find the relevant cluster of packages.\nFocused Collaboration: Developers working on related packages can coordinate efforts, avoid duplication, and build tools that work well together.\nDeeper Expertise: Sub-ecosystems become hubs of specialized knowledge, accelerating innovation within that domain.\nTargeted Resources: It becomes easier to create specific tutorials, documentation examples, and showcase demonstrations (like introductory videos!) for a particular area.\nClearer Roadmap: Identifying strengths and gaps within a sub-ecosystem can help guide future development efforts.\n\n\n\nExploring Potential & Existing Sub-Ecosystems\nBased on the packages currently under the JuliaHealth organization and exciting areas of growth, here are some potential sub-ecosystems we envision.
